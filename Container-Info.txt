Containers. Everybody and their mothers loves containers apparently, with the big dog Docker in a clear lead. But there is an contentor I feel like isn't given much love; Open Container Initiative -- https://opencontainers.org/
#Open Container Initiative and ORAS (https://oras.land/docs/quickstart)
While there are images, there is also non-image items that may be nessecary to include in the image such as a video or music or whatever that doesn't direct contribute to the building of an appliation. And how do you manage those non-core items (or arefacts) that you want to bundle with your image? That's where ORAS (https://oras.land/docs/) comes in!
