# ITadmin-framework
A collection of tool, techinques, and information placed in how-to guides, so I can stop losing working, useful and/or helpful tech stacks scattered across multiple worksites.


My collection of useful IT/SYS admin tools, techinques and information I find useful. In all my years of administrating, I find little nuggets of info here, or a usefull tool there, and the perfect StackExchange answer rarely, and when I do I have to add them to list(s) scattered across many job sites and I have to rebuild my stacks - I hate that.
So this is my central repo of tech stacks I will build so I can stop forgetting them.

 A framework is a guide, and guides are structures bits of advice and all adivce is autobiographical.
